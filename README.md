## What you need to know

## When to Use Template
This template is ideal for:
- Starting new Android application projects
- Learning Android development fundamentals
- Creating examples or prototypes
- Standardizing project setups within a team or organization

The template provides the minimal necessary configuration to start development, allowing developers to focus on implementing application-specific features rather than setting up the project structure.


## Benefits of Using the Template
Using this template offers several advantages for Android development:
- Consistent Project Structure: 
- Follows Android best practices for organization
- Time Savings: Eliminates repetitive setup of standard configurations
- Standardization: Provides a common foundation for multiple projects
- Reduced Setup Errors: Avoids common configuration mistakes
- Faster Development Start: Enables developers to begin coding features immediately

The Template serves as a foundation that can be extended and customized according to specific project requirements, while maintaining alignment with Android development standards.
